                    <p class="mb-0" data-aos="fade-up">RADgov created this application to support sections of the Traffic Engineering Division by encouraging better coordination and administrative processes within the department. We work closely with the traffic department to design the data and information capturing screens such that vast amounts of data can be captured using a single screen for a specific device. This application is a browser-based system, which facilitates the process of filing work orders and related information online electronically. This product is a set of modular components designed to efficiently schedule, approve, assign, track, coordinate, prioritize, and follow-up activities. This provides a common portal and medium for sharing information across the engineering division as well as other government agencies. Our system is worth the choice because it automates management processes and allows efficiency in addressing issues and concerns improving efficiencies including time and costs. </p>
