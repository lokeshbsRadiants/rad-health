 What&#39;s your exit plan strategy?  What are you waiting for?\r\n\r\nJust send me an email and we&#39;ll add you to our marketing platform so we&#39;ll keep you apprised of our future technology deal flow.  We bring 2-5 deals to market per month on average.\r\n\r\nYou can also bookmark our website, https://www.pronovpartners.com/engagements/ to check in on future deals anytime.\r\n\r\nYou can also hire us to &#34;go out and get something&#34; if you have a specific set of zip codes or other criteria where you want us to complete a specific, proactive & dedicated M&A process for you.  Just reply back and we can discuss further anytime.  Thanks!\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\n-Rick.\r\n-- \r\nRick Carlson\r\nCEO\r\nProNova Partners\r\n825 Wilshire Blvd., Suite 536\r\nSanta Monica, CA  90401\r\nPhone: 833-776-6682\r\nEmail:  RC7374@ProNovaPartners.com\r\nWeb: https://www.ProNovaPartners.com\r\n_______________________________________\r\n\r\nThe information in this email is confidential and intended solely for the recipients listed.
